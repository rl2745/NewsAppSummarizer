# NewsSummarizerApp
This Android App Provides a Summary of an Article

I built this project using Android Studio and the languages 
Java and XML. I have tested this app on an Nexus 5 emulator 
and on my HTC Desire 626s android phone.


Instructions:
Download the APK file onto your android phone and install the app.
Once you have installed the app, open it and type in (or copy and paste) 
a URL of an article that you would like summarized in the text box. 
After doing so, click on the 'Get Article Summary' button in order 
to see the summary of the article on the next page. Press the back key 
on your android device if you would like to start over and get the 
summary of another article.


For Developers:
In order to use the source code I've included in the main directory, 
you must create an account on Aylien.com in order to get a key and 
ID for their text processing API, which I have used in this project.
